# Gossip Simulator

I created this simulator to help me show how Gossip Protocols work in my talks, for example [this one](https://youtu.be/QQ2n1UX3Qwg).

When I started reading about Gossip I couldn't find a good introduction, there were thounsands of papers but I didn't a find a good and simple summary. So I created this one: In http://managementfromscratch.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/introduction-to-gossip/

After that I gave a talk at https://paperswelove.org, which was complete theoretical and I realized it was too much info for one hour. That's why I came up with idea of a simulator to help understand how they work.
